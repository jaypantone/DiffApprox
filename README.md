# DifferentialApproximation

`DA-0-5` is a work-in-progress Maple library for empirically predicting the asymptotic behavior of integer sequences based on some known initial terms. This code is not yet fit for public consumption, but I am always more than happy to apply it to sequences of interest, so please feel free to contact me at <jay.pantone@gmail.com>.
